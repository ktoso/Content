## Introduction

Swift Actors

- designed to protect you from low-level data races in the same process
- compile-time enforced actor isolation checks

Distributed actors

- designed to protect you from low-level data races across multiple processes
- e.g., communication among multiple devices or servers in a cluster

## Distributed actors

- By using distributed actors, we're able to establish a channel between two processes and send messages between them
- Distributed actors still isolate their state and still can only communicate using asynchronous messages
- It's ok to have multiple distributed actors in the same process
- Distributed actors are just actors, but can participate in remote interactions whenever necessary
- Distributed actors always belong to some distributed actor system, which handles all the serialization and networking necessary to perform remote calls
- Every distributed actor is assigned an `id`, uniquely identify said actor in the entire distributed actor system that it is part of.
  - `id`s are assigned by the distributed actor system as the actor is initialized, and later managed by that system (we cannot declare or assign the `id` property manually)

Location transparency:

- ability to be potentially remote without having to change how we interact with such distributed actor
- regardless where a distributed actor is located, we can interact with it the same way
- allows us to transparently move our actors, without having to change their implementation

## Road to distributed actors

1. Pick a local actor that you'd like to move to distribute actor
2. Turn it into a (still local) distributed actor
3. Move the distributed actor `ActorSystem` to be remote 
4. Setup server side app

### Example

1. Pick a local actor that you'd like to move to distribute actor

```swift
public actor BotPlayer: Identifiable {
  nonisolated public let id: ActorIdentity = .random
  
  var ai: RandomPlayerBotAI
  var gameState: GameState
  
  public init(team: CharacterTeam) {
    self.gameState = .init()
    self.ai = RandomPlayerBotAI(playerID: self.id, team: team)
  }
  
  public func makeMove() throws -> GameMove {
    return try ai.decideNextMove(given: &gameState)
  }
  
  public func opponentMoved(_ move: GameMove) async throws {
    try gameState.mark(move)
  }
}
```

2. Turn it into a (still local) distributed actor

- import the `Distributed` module ([api docs][api-docs])
- add the `distributed` keyword in front of the `actor` keyword, this way your actor will: 
  - conform to `DistributedActor` protocol
  - enable a number of additional compile time checks

- The compiler will asks as to declare which `ActorSystem` our distributed actor can be used with
  - we can use one of the systems that come with the `Distributed` module, such as `LocalTestingDistributedActor`, or define our own
  - we can declare a module-wide `DefaultDistributedActorSystem` typealias (used by all distributed actors), or an `ActorSystem` typealias in the body of the specific actor

- each `distributed actor` needs to declare an `actorSystem` compiler synthesized property - accept an actor system in the initializer, and pass it through to the property
- add the `distributed` keyboard to instance methods that you'd like to expose for remote calls
  - ensure that all `distributed` methods parameters and return values conform to the serialization requirement of the actor system (e.g., `Codable`)

```swift
import Distributed // üëàüèª import the distributed module

//         üëáüèª add distributed attribute
public distributed actor BotPlayer: Identifiable {
  typealias ActorSystem = LocalTestingDistributedActorSystem // üëàüèª declare the ActorSystem this actor belongs to
  
  var ai: RandomPlayerBotAI
  var gameState: GameState
  
  //                                  üëáüèª accept the actorSystem during init
  public init(team: CharacterTeam, actorSystem: ActorSystem) {
    self.actorSystem = actorSystem // üëàüèª set compiler synthesized property
    self.gameState = .init()
    self.ai = RandomPlayerBotAI(playerID: self.id, team: team)
  }
  
  //        üëáüèª add distributed keyword to instance methods that can be called remotely
  public distributed func makeMove() throws -> GameMove {
    return try ai.decideNextMove(given: &gameState)
  }
  
  public distributed func opponentMoved(_ move: GameMove) async throws {
    try gameState.mark(move)
  }
}
```

3. Move the distributed actor `ActorSystem` to be remote 

- This step requires you to define your own `ActorSystem`, which will be used in both your app and your server
- see [sample app][sa] for a `SampleWebSocketActorSystem` example

4. Setup server side app

```swift
import Distributed
import TicTacFishShared

/// Stand alone server-side swift application, running our SampleWebSocketActorSystem in server mode.
@main
struct Boot {
  
  static func main() {
    let system = try! SampleWebSocketActorSystem(mode: .serverOnly(host: "localhost", port: 8888))
    
    //       üëáüèª this is a pattern in sample app, not an API
    system.registerOnDemandResolveHandler { id in
      // We create new BotPlayers "ad-hoc" as they are requested for.
      // Subsequent resolves are able to resolve the same instance.
      if system.isBotID(id) {
        return system.makeActorWithID(id) {
          OnlineBotPlayer(team: .rodents, actorSystem: system)
        }
      }
      
      return nil // unable to create-on-demand for given id
    }
    
    print("========================================================")
    print("=== TicTacFish Server Running on: ws://\(system.host):\(system.port) ==")
    print("========================================================")
    
    try await server.terminated // waits effectively forever (until we shut down the system)
  }
}
```
